<title>Single Event Effects</title>
</head><body background="see_data/blue_paper.gif">


<h1>Single Event Effects</h1>


<p>A <i>single event effect</i> (SEE) results from, as the term suggests,
a single, energetic particle.  The possibility of single-event
upsets was first postulated by Wallmark and Marcus in 1962.[1]  The
first actual satellite anomalies were reported by Binder <i>et al.</i> in 1975.[2]
Some of the early pioneering work was by May and Woods, who
investigated alpha-particle-induced soft errors.[3]  In their work the
source of alpha particles was not from space but rather from the
natural decay of trace (ppm) concentrations of uranium and
thorium present in integrated circuit packaging materials. </p>


<p>Single event phenomena can be classified into three effects
(in order of permanency):</p>

<ol>
<li>Single event upset (soft error)
</li><li>Single event latchup (soft or hard error)
</li><li>Single event burnout (hard failure)
</li></ol>

<h3>Single Event Upset</h3>

<p><i>Single event upset</i> (SEU) is defined by NASA as "radiation-induced
errors in microelectronic circuits caused when charged particles
(usually from the radiation belts or from cosmic rays) lose energy
by ionizing the medium through which they pass, leaving behind a
wake of electron-hole pairs." [Ref: NASA Thesaurus]  SEUs are transient 
soft errors, and are non-destructive.  A reset or rewriting of the device results
in normal device behavior thereafter.  An SEU may  occur in analog,
digital, or optical components, or may have effects in surrounding
interface circuitry.  SEUs typically appear as transient pluses in
logic or support circuitry, or as bit flips in memory cells or
registers.  Also possible is a <i>multiple-bit SEU</i> in which 
a single ion hits two or more bits causing simultaneous errors.
Multiple-bit SEU is a problem for single-bit <i>error detection and correction</i> 
(EDAC) where it is impossible to assign bits within a word to different chips 
(<i>e.g.</i>, a problem for DRAMs and certain SRAMs).
A severe SEU is the single-event functional interrupt
(SEFI) in which an SEU in the device's control circuitry places the
device into a test mode, halt, or undefined state.  The SEFI halts
normal operations, and requires a power reset to recover.</p>

<h3>Single Event Latchup</h3>

<p><i>Single event latchup</i> (SEL) is a condition that causes loss
of device functionality due to a single-event induced current
state.  Kolasinski <i>et al.</i> first observed SEL in 1979 during
ground testing.[4] SELs are hard errors, and are potentially
destructive (<i>i.e.</i>, may cause permanent damage).  The SEL results
in a high operating current, above device specifications.  The latched
condition can destroy the device, drag down the bus voltage,
or damage the power supply. Originally, the concern was latchup
caused by heavy ions, however, latchup can be caused by protons
in very sensitive devices.[5,6] An SEL is cleared by a power
off-on reset or power strobing of the device.  If power is not
removed quickly, catastrophic failure may occur due to excessive
heating, or metallization or bond wire failure. 
SEL is strongly temperature dependent: the threshold for latchup decreases at 
high temperature, and the cross section increases as well.[7,8]
</p>

<h3>Single Event Burnout</h3>

<p><i>Single event burnout</i> (SEB) is a condition that can cause device
destruction due to a high current state in a power transistor.  SEB
causes the device to fail permanently.  SEBs include burnout of power
MOSFETs, gate rupture, frozen bits, and noise in CCDs (charge-coupled
devices).  SEB of power MOSFETs was first reported by Waskiewicz
<i>et al.</i> in 1986.[9] Only SEB of n-channel power MOSFETs has
been reported.[10] An SEB can be triggered in a power MOSFET biased
in the OFF state (<i>i.e.</i>, blocking a high drain-source voltage)
when a heavy ion passing through deposits enough charge to turn the device
on.  SEB susceptibility has been shown to decrease with increasing temperature.[11]</p>

<p>A power MOSFET may undergo <i>single-event gate rupture</i> (SEGR), which
is the formation of a conducting path (<i>i.e.</i>, localized dielectric
breakdown) in the gate oxide resulting in a destructive burnout.
Fischer was the first to report on SEGR of power MOSFETs in 1987.[12]
SEB can also occur in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as was
first reported by Titus <i>et al.</i> in 1991.[13]  Swift <i>et al.</i>
have described a new hard error, that of single-event dielectric
rupture (SEDR).[14] SEDR (also referred to as micro-damage)
occurs in CMOS and is similar to SEGR observed in power MOSFETs.</p>

<h2>Environmental and Design Factors</h2>

<p>To estimate the upset rate, one must consider the mechanism by which
radiation particles cause the anomaly.  The SEUs
are caused by two different space radiation sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>high energy protons, and
</li><li>cosmic rays, specifically,
the heavy ion component of either solar or galactic origins.
</li></ol>

<p>The latter heavy ions cause direct ionization within a device.
Protons can make a large contribution to the overall upset rate (particularly for LEO).
When the feature size is &lt;0.3 µm, then protons will create SEU by direct ionization.
Protons typically do not cause an upset through direct ionization, 
but rather through complex nuclear reactions (spallation) in the vicinity 
of the sensitive node (see figure below).
<i>Spallation</i> is a nuclear reaction in which two or more fragments
or particles are ejected from the target nucleus; it is the heavy recoil nuclei ions, 
such as <sup>25</sup>Mg, which can then cause SEU.  Example
spallation reactions from neutrons and protons include
Si(<i>n</i>,<img src="see_data/greek_alpha.gif" alt="a">)Mg, Si(<i>n</i>,<i>p</i>)Al [15], 
Si(<i>p</i>,2<i>p</i>)Al, and 
Si(<i>p</i>,<i>p</i><img src="see_data/greek_alpha.gif" alt="a">)Mg.[16,17,18] </p>

Schematic showing how galactic cosmic rays deposit energy in an electronic device.<br>
(Source <i>Spacecraft Anomalies due to Radiation Environment in Space</i>
by Lauriente and Vampola [19]) </p>

<p>Solar flare particle events pose the most extreme SEU producing
environment, especially for spacecraft in interplanetary space.[20]
Experiments aboard the Combined Release and Radiation Effects
Satellite (CRRES) showed a dramatic increase during a solar
flare.[21]  However, 90% of all SEUs on CRRES were produced by protons
contrary to the pre-launch prediction that most upsets would be
caused by cosmic rays.[22] Gussenhoven <i>et al.</i> state that 
based on CRRES data that most single-event upsets come from high 
energy protons via nuclear interactions and not through direct 
deposition from either protons or cosmic rays.[23]  
For LEO satellites, trapped protons,
especially in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), are the greatest
SEE threat.  The SAA, located at 30° S. latitude, 34.5° E.
longitude, is shown in the geomagnetic field of Figure 2.  Solar cycle
activity affects the presence of trapped electrons and protons as shown below:</p>

(SAA) which is centered off the southeastern coast of South America<br>
(from the <a href="http://see.msfc.nasa.gov/">
Space Environments &amp; Effects Program</a> at NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center). </p>


<p>Given the division of SEEs into soft and hard errors, it is obvious
that permanent hard errors are to be completely avoided.
Avoidance may be realized through parts selection and shielding.
Unfortunately, shielding is of little value for preventing SEUs.
For mitigating soft SEEs, other methods, such as error
detection and correction (EDAC), and redundancy, may be employed.</p>

<p>Shielding typically has little effect. Shielding high-energy protons while 
observing weight restrictions is a difficult task.  Adams found that under some 
conditions that shielding can worsen the problem, since as ions slow down in the 
shielding their LET increases.[24]
Shielding produces significant reductions in soft components like solar flare 
particles, and moderate reductions in the trapped proton flux.
Shielding is ineffective against galactic cosmic rays due to their high energies. </p>

<h4>Critical Charge</h4>

<p>SEU was first observed in bipolar flip-flops in 1979.
Original work in this area was treated with skepticism.
SEU has emerged as one of the major issues for application of microelectronics in space.
SEU effects have become worse as devices have evolved because of
lower &#8220;critical charge&#8221; due to small device dimensions, and
large numbers of transistors per chip and overall complexity.
Nichols ranks the susceptibility of current technologies to SEUs:[25] </p>

<ul>
<li>CMOS/SOS (least susceptible)
</li><li>CMOS
</li><li>Standard bipolar
</li><li>Low power Schottky bipolar
</li><li>NMOS DRAMs (most susceptible)
</li></ul>

<p>For GaAs circuits, latchup and burnout do not occur.[26] However,
SEU susceptibility is slightly higher in GaAs devices than in Si devices.[27]</p>

<p>Device immunity is determined by its <i>linear energy transfer threshold</i> (LET<sub>th</sub>).
The LET<sub>th</sub> is defined as the minimum LET to cause a single-event effect at a 
particle fluence of 10<sup>7</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.  
SEE-immune is defined as a device having an LET<sub>th</sub> &gt; 100 MeV·cm²/mg [28] (~iron threshold, Z&gt;26).
Low LET<sub>th</sub> implies proton sensitivity.
If a device is not SEU immune, the device is analyzed for SEU rates and effects 
as follows: </p>

<table align="center" border="1">

<tbody><tr>
<th>Device LET<sub>th</sub>
</th><th>Environment to be Assessed
</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>&lt; 10 MeV·cm²/mg
</td><td>Cosmic ray ions, trapped protons, solar flare protons
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>10 - 100 MeV·cm²/mg
</td><td>Cosmic ray ions
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>&gt; 100 MeV·cm²/mg
</td><td>No analysis required
</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>The LET<sub>th</sub> usually reduces as a device accumulates large TID.[29]

</p><p>The present trends (<i>e.g.</i>, device size and power reduction, line resolution 
increase, increased memory and speed) will only heighten the SEU susceptibility.
This is easily seen when one considers the device as a simple capacitor (<i>C</i>) upon 
which the ionized particle deposits sufficient charge (<i>Q</i>) to result in a voltage 
(<i>i.e.</i>, logic state) change. SEU occurs when LET &gt; <i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i>. </p>

<p>Since the LET<sub>th</sub> is equivalent to the LET required to produce a voltage change 
(<img src="see_data/greeku_delta.gif" alt="D"><i>V</i>) sufficient for an SEU, then mathematically:
</p>

<p align="center">LET<sub>th</sub> <img src="see_data/greek_alpha.gif" alt="a"> 
<img src="see_data/greeku_delta.gif" alt="D"><i>V</i> = <i>Q</i>/<i>C</i> </p>

<p>As the size of these active devices decreases, the capacitance will decrease and 
so the charge necessary to induce the SEU. The depth of the devices has been generally 
unchanged; it is the length and width of these devices that have been reduced.  
If we consider a square device of feature size, <i>L x L</i>, the critical charge for 
state change is proportional to the feature size squared (<i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i> 
<img src="see_data/greek_alpha.gif" alt="a"> <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>).  Robinson <i>et al.</i> 
present the measured critical charge for a number of IC technologies (including NMOS, 
CMOS/bulk CMOS/SOS, i<sup>2</sup>L, GaAs, ECL, CMOS/SOI, and VHSIC bipolar) as being:[30] </p>

<p align="center"><i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i> = (0.023 pC/µm<sup>2</sup>) <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>This <i>critical charge</i> is that charge necessary to flip a binary "1" to a "0" or 
vice-versa, but is less than the total stored charge.
Specifically, <i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i> is then the difference between the storage node charge and 
the minimum charge required for the sensing amplifier to read correctly.[31]
In SRAM circuits, <i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i> depends not just on the charge collected but also the 
temporal shape of the current pulse.

<h3>Elementary Model for Heavy Ions</h3>

<p>A very elementary model of SEU behavior can be formed using the concept of 
LET through some depth of a parallelepiped-shaped device.
Start by calculating the energy deposited, <i>E<sub>dep</sub></i>, as the particle 
traverses a chord of length <i>s</i> through the sensitive volume of the device
(see diagram below). </p>

<p align="center"><i>E<sub>dep</sub></i> = <i>LET</i> <img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p"> <i>s</i> </p>

<p>The deposited charge depends on the energy required to generate an electron-hole pair,
<i>w<sub>ehp</sub></i>, </p>

<p align="center"><i>Q<sub>dep</sub></i> = <i>E<sub>dep</sub> q</i> / <i>w<sub>ehp</sub></i> </p>

<p>where <i>q</i>=1.6022x10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs/<i>e</i> and <i>w<sub>ehp</sub></i> for
a few materials are given in the table below: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="see_data/SEUion-model.gif" alt="SEUion-model" align="center" height="120" width="360"> </p>

<p>Using such a simple approach, a first-order estimate of the minimum LET required for 
causing an SEU can be computed.  Consider a parallelepiped of dimensions <i>a</i>, 
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i> where <i>c</i> is the device depth.  The minimum LET corresponds 
to the maximum chord length possible, <i>s<sub>max</sub></i>, which is the diagonal 
of the parallelepiped. </p>

<p align="center"><i>s<sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub></i> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>The minimum LET necessary to cause an upset can then be calculated from </p>

<p align="center">LET<sub>th</sub> = <i>Q<sub>crit</sub> w<sub>ehp</sub></i> / (<i>q</i> <img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p"> <i>s<sub>max</sub></i>) </p>

<p>Likewise, there is a minimum distance, <i>s<sub>min</sub></i>, that a particle of 
given LET must travel before being able to deposit sufficient energy to cause an SEU. </p>

<p align="center"><i>s<sub>min</sub></i> = <i>Q<sub>crit</sub> w<sub>ehp</sub></i> / (<i>q</i> <img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p"> LET) </p>

<p>Hence, the particle <i>angle of incidence</i> upon the device is also important.  
As the incidence angle deviates from normal, the path length traversed by the radiation 
increases.  The angle from incident at which upsets occur for a given particle LET is 
known as the <i>critical angle</i>, <img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O"><sub>c</sub> </p>

<p align="center">cos(<img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O"><sub>c</sub>) = LET / LET<sub>C</sub> </p>

<p>The particles that produce upset are between an angle of <img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O"><sub>c</sub>
and <img src="see_data/greek_pi.gif" alt="pi">/2. Therefore, there are two potential 
cases (note LET<sub>C</sub> &lt; LET<sub>th</sub>)</p>
<ol>
<li>If LET &gt; LET<sub>C</sub>, then all incident angles produce upset.
</li><li>If LET &lt; LET<sub>C</sub>, then there is a critical angle, <img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O"><sub>c</sub>, above which upsets occur.
</li></ol>

<p align="center"><img src="see_data/criticalangle.gif" alt="CriticalAngle" align="center" height="70" width="240"> </p>

<p>For a parallelepiped particles incident at an angle <img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O"> 
have a path that is 1/cos(<img src="see_data/greek_theta.gif" alt="O">) longer than 
the path at normal incidence, thus producing more ionization charge. 
[Note: This "cosine law" fails in some cases, and must be checked for each device technology.]
Unlike SEU behavior, SEB and SEGR susceptibility has been shown to decrease with increasing angles of incidence.
[7,8,32,33] </p>

<p>The energy deposited per unit path length as an energetic particle travels 
through a material is the <i>linear energy transfer</i> (LET).  Note that the LET is 
normally defined by <i>dE</i>/<i>dx</i>; however, the LET used in SEU studies is 
actually the <i>mass stopping power</i> defined by (<i>dE</i>/<i>dx</i>)/<img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p"> 
where <img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p"> is the material density.  
This results in an LET unit of MeV/(mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of material, which is the 
energy loss per density thickness.  <i>Density thickness</i> (<i>t<sub>d</sub></i>) 
is the product of the material density and its thickness (<i>t</i>), 
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> =<img src="see_data/greek_rho.gif" alt="p">·<i>t</i>.  
Therefore, the density thickness describes the areal density of electrons 
(electrons/cm<sup>2</sup>).  The LET is dependent on the particle, its energy, 
and the material traversed. </p>

<h3>Practical SEU Calculation</h3>

<p>The upset rate may be reported as errors per day per chip, or 
errors per day per bit (errors/bit-day).  Error rates of hardened 
devices can be of the order of 10<sup>-8</sup> errors/bit-day; 
unhardened devices are generally several orders of magnitude higher.</p>

Effects on Microelectronics</a>," NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]</center>


<p>There are three basic steps in the calculation of SEU Rates:
</p><ol>
<li>Measure the cross section (<img src="see_data/greek_sigma.gif" alt="s">) versus LET for example using
accelerator testing.  The device <i>cross section</i> is defined as the ratio of the 
number of upsets to the particle fluence.  The experimentally determined cross 
section is a function of particle energy (LET).<br><br>

[Source: The Aerospace Corporation <a href="http://www.aero.org/capabilities/seet/primer.html">SEE Primer</a>]</center>
<br><br>

</li><li>Determine the sensitive device volume.
The sensitive volume is smaller than the actual device physical volume.
The sensitive volume is generally different for SEE from heavy ions and protons, 
as well as SEL.
The sensitive geometry and critical charge are the most difficult parameters to determine.

</li><li>To determine the device error rate, integrate the cross section and 
sensitive device volume with the LET spectrum.

<p>In LEO, the inner belt (trapped) protons are the most important source.  
For LEO satellites, trapped protons, especially in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), 
are the greatest SEE threat.
For GEO, the cosmic and solar particles initiate SEEs. 
The galactic cosmic ray environment is modeled using CREME;
the solar flares can be modeled using JPL or CREME models.
Solar flare particle events pose the most extreme SEU producing environment, 
especially for spacecraft in interplanetary space.[20] </p>

[Source: <a href="http://parts.jpl.nasa.gov/asic/title.page.html">The NASA
ASIC Guide: Assuring ASICS for Space</a>]</p>

<p>The Heinrich Curve above shows the integral energy loss spectrum at GEO.  
The 100% curve corresponds to solar max condition, and the environment is always worse.  
The 10% curve combines solar minimum cosmic rays and solar proton activity so that the 
environment is worse only 10% of the time.  The 0.03% curve corresponds to an anomalously
large solar flare. </p>

<p>Petersen <i>et al.</i> have developed a simple expression for the upset rate at 
GEO from galactic rays.[34] The GEO flux is due to galactic cosmic rays since protons 
at the outer edge of the radiation belts is assumed negligible. SEU error rate 
expressions are obtained using chord distribution function for the cross section. 
After integrating the flux and cross section over the range of energies (LET), 
the "figure of merit" formula for the error rate for the 10% environment results: </p>

<p align="center"><i>R</i> = 5x10<sup>-10</sup> <img src="see_data/greek_sigma.gif" alt="s"><sub>sat</sub> / (LET<sub>crit</sub>)<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>where <i>R</i> is the SEU error rate in errors per bit-day; 
<img src="see_data/greek_sigma.gif" alt="s"><sub>sat</sub> is the saturation SEU 
cross section in µm<sup>2</sup>; and LET<sub>crit</sub> is the critical LET
in units of pC/µm.  For design purposes, the error rate may be estimated using the
above expression with <img src="see_data/greek_sigma.gif" alt="s"><sub>sat</sub> = <i>a b</i>
with (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i> &gt;&gt; <i>c</i>), and
LET<sub>crit</sub>=<i>Q<sub>crit</sub></i>/<i>c</i> where <i>c</i> is the silicon device 
depth, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are its sides in microns (µm).
The above expression provides an upper-bound estimate.
One can replace the numeral 5 in the &#8220;figure of merit&#8221; equation with a value of 3.5 for GaAs devices.
Multipliers have been developed for the figure of merit (FOM) formula to scale the error 
rate to other environments, especially solar flares: </p>
