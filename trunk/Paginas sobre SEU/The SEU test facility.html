<b>The SEU Test Facility</b>

<dt><b>1. Introduction</b>
</dt><dd>
The uninterrupted and progressive miniaturization of microelectronic
devices while resulting in more powerful computers, has also made these
computers more susceptible to the effects of ionizing radiation. This
is of particular concern for space applications due to the radiation
fields encountered outside the protective terrestrial atmosphere and
magnetosphere. Starting in 1987, a coalition of US government agencies
(NSA, <a href="http://flick.gsfc.nasa.gov/radhome.htm">NASA</a>, 
<a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">NRL</a> and 
<a href="http://sc-www.army.mil/">USASSDC</a>
) collaborated with
<a href="http://www.bnl.gov/">BNL</a>
to develop a powerful and user-friendly test facility for investigating
space-radiation effects on micro-electronic devices[1]. The main type
of effects studied are the so called Single Event Upsets (SEUs) where
ionization caused by the passage of a single heavy ion produces a bit
flip and hence a computer error or a system crash. Such events can also
lead to destructive latchups and burnouts which must be prevented at
almost any cost. The wide variety of beams available at the BNL Tandem,
while lower in energy than the average heavy ions encountered in space,
do cover the entire range of specific ionization and of linear energy
transfer values (LET), and are therefore well suited for simulating
these effects under controlled conditions. To make this possible, new
systems had to be developed to produce uniform beams and to precisely
control and monitor ion fluxes ranging from about 100 to about
10,000,000 particles per cm<sup>2</sup>
per second. This facility has evolved into a highly automated and well
interlocked computer controlled system which can be easily operated by
first-time users on the day of their arrival. High beam purity, good
beam uniformity and precise dosimetry are provided to a large community
of American and European users in support of their space programs.

The heavy 
<a href="http://tvdg10.phy.bnl.gov/species.html">ions</a>used for SEU
testing are generated using an upgraded model MP tandem Van de Graaff
accelerator [2] which is operated at a maximum terminal voltage of 15
MV. The range of energies and corresponding LET values achievable for a
few representative beams are shown in fig.1. Many other ions are
available and, up to date, about 35 different elements have been
accelerated.

line. Most common TVDG ion species and a variety of targets are
available. The program accepts energies at or well beyond those
available at the TVDG.
</p><p>Negative ions are generated in a sputter-type ion source
operated at ~-150 kV with respect to ground and a first mass selection
is performed by means of an inflection magnet. This magnet which has a
mass resolution of 1/40 is operated at ~-120 kV and is provided with a
hall-probe gaussmeter. Then the ~150 keV negative ions are injected
into the accelerator contained in a pressure vessel which is filled
with insulating gas containing ~50% SF<sub>6</sub>, ~40% N, and ~10% CO<sub>2</sub>,
pressurized to about 10 atm. The negative ions are accelerated in an
evacuated acceleration tube to the high voltage terminal which can be
operated at voltages ranging from ~1 to 15 MV. In the high voltage
terminal the negative ions are converted to positive ions by allowing
them to pass through a carbon foil which causes several electrons to be
stripped off the ions but which is thin enough (typically ~5 ug/cm<sup>2</sup>)
to cause an almost negligible energy loss. A second stripper foil,
located at the 75% voltage point can be optionally used to achieve even
higher charge states and consequently higher energy gain during the
last stage of acceleration.
</p><p>A beam-calibrated generating voltmeter located at the wall of
the pressure vessel is used to measure the terminal voltage with a
precision of 0.1-0.2%. The energy of the different charge-state
components emerging from the accelerator is therefore also known to
this precision. A highly precise double-focusing magnet used in
conjunction with narrow object and image slits is then used to select
one of these components and to determine the energy with even greater
precision. The field in this magnet is measured by means of a nuclear
magnetic resonance probe and the magnetic rigidity of the selected
component is thus determined with a resolution of ~10<sup>-3</sup> and a precision of ~10<sup>-4</sup>.
In spite of this high resolution, there are occasions in which
different charge-state components of some ions can have close enough
magnetic rigidities as to cause possible confusion or beam
contamination, especially when both strippers are used. A cross-field
velocity selector (Wien filter) has been installed to further purify
the beam and a number of procedures have been implemented to detect and
eliminate any residual
contaminants.
</p><p>First a computer search is performed to identify possible known
beam contaminants. Charge-state
combinations which may generate beams of similar rigidities are then
avoided. This computer search can be skipped in the case of well
established beams for which extensive experience exists. The next step
is to select at least three different charge states by varying the
terminal voltage. The measured voltages and beam intensities are then
compared with computer predictions and the energies are verified by
means of a silicon detector (see below). If no anomalies are
encountered the desired beam is deflected in the switcher magnet and is
allowed to traverse the multiple scattering foil. Some of the ions
scattered by this foil enter a silicon surface barrier-detector, the
pulse height spectrum of which is recorded in a multichannel analyzer.
Here the energy and purity of the beam are checked making use of the
fact that if different charge-state components are present they will
have different energies. If a single peak is observed at the correct
position the final energy is calculated by making a small correction to
take into account the energy loss in the gold foil, and the beam is
sent into the target room. Here an independent energy and purity check
is performed with one of several alpha-particle calibrated silicon
surface barrier detector systems. Some of these detectors are also
partly covered with aluminum foils of different, calibrated thicknesses
and can thus be used for precise on-line LET measurements. </p><p>
The ion flux reaching the part being tested can be adjusted by
utilizing ion source controls, a variable aperture at the accelerator
entrance, object and image slit settings, scattering foil thickness
selection, and beam sweeping amplitude changes. A method useful for
reducing the flux to very low values consists of using a carbon
stripping foil at the image location to generate a charge state
distribution and then selecting a peak component of this distribution
with the switcher magnet. Doing this allows one to easily maintain a
beam intensity at the regulating slits sufficient for stable
accelerator operation. </p><p>
Beam uniformity at the device mounted on the goniometer stage is
achieved by multiple scattering in the foil at the entrance to the
target room by two dimensional sweeping with two steerer magnets or by
a combination of these methods. Different sweeping frequencies in the
range 5-30 Hz are selected for each magnet and their lack of
synchronization is monitored with an oscilloscope. The uniformity is
monitored and verified by a set of four plastic scintillation detectors
surrounding the useful part of the beam and by a fifth detector which
can be rotated into the central on-axis position. These five detectors
are provided with precisely machined collimators of identical area.
Usually the counting rate in the central detector is somewhat higher
than the average of the other four and a corresponding automatic
correction is applied to the fluence as measured by the outer
detectors. The divergence of the beam while traveling from the plane of
the detectors to the location of the tested device is taken into
account through a small, calculated
geometric correction. </p><p>
During a prolonged measurement, the central detector is periodically
and automatically rotated into the beam, the correction factor is
updated and if it becomes too large the users and the operators are
alerted. The flux and uniformity are constantly monitored in the
diagnostic chamber and displayed numerically and graphically in a
specially designed PC based system [3] which is located in the control
room and which also provides alarms when the flux or other parameters
fall outside selected limits.
</p><p>The beam can be intercepted by a Faraday cup and by a "parts
shutter". The beam is collimated by a variable and rotatable iris which
is adjusted so as to avoid bombarding parts adjacent to the one under
study. By maintaining the plane of the iris parallel to the test board
the illuminated area on the board remains constant when both planes are
rotated. For some tests, other than normal incidence is chosen to vary
the "effective" LET value.
</p><p>The entire target-room system is computer controlled and
automated with user-friendly menu-driven software. The system can
"remember" and reproduce the positions of a large number of devices on
the board. The information is fed into the system by positioning each
device with the aid of a joy-stick and by pressing the "enter" key. To
aid in the location of the devices a light beam, which is almost
collinear with the ion beam, is generated with a laser and reflected by
a mirror. The collimated light spot on the device is then observed on a
monitor connected to a television camera. Once the test board
information has been entered, a test sequence can be set up by
selecting desired fluences and effective LET values. After recording
the number of upsets for different LET values the system provides
on-line display of the single event upset cross-section curves and
documentation in the form of plots, printed tables and information
recorded on floppy discs. Good examples of such data can be found in
ref. [4].
</p><p>If the chamber needs to be opened the total vacuum cycle time
is less than 5 minutes. The large number of chips that can be
simultaneously installed and the fast, totally automated vacuum system
add to the unprecedented testing efficiency which is achieved with this
system. </p><p>
